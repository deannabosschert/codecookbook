# Digitalisering
------------------------------------------

Digitalisering is a process of transforming data into digital form.
This is done by converting the data into a digital form that can be stored in a database.
Since the data is stored in a database, it can be accessed by other programs.
When the data is stored in a database, it is called a digital representation.
